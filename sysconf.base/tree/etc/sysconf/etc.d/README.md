# sysconf-etc.d: an manager of conf.d-style configurations

## Example

Suppose you have:

### /etc/gitconfig.d/alias.gitconfig
```
[alias]
  st = status
  ci = commit
```

### /etc/gitconfig.d/colors.gitconfig
```
[color]
  ui = auto
[color "branch"]
  current = yellow reverse
  local = yellow
  remote = green
```

### /etc/sysconf/etc.d/gitconfig.meta.conf
```
SYSCONF_ETC_CONFIG_TARGET_CONF=/etc/gitconfig
SYSCONF_ETC_CONFIG_TYPE=reference
SYSCONF_ETC_CONFIG_BEGIN="[include]"
SYSCONF_ETC_CONFIG_EXPRESSION="  path = "
```

Then you can run: ``` sysconf-etc.d update gitconfig ```

It will generate:

### /etc/gitconfig

```
# GENERATED BY sysconf-etc.d

[include]
  path = /etc/gitconfig.d/colors.gitconfig
  path = /etc/gitconfig.d/alias.gitconfig
```


## Rationale

Many Linux distributions, including Debian GNU/Linux, often use de
_conf.d_ pattern to split configuration package into multiple files.

The need is obious: while programs need their "own" configuration to
function (like _/etc/programX.conf_), that config is actually
maintained through different administrative logics.

Package installation deals with files. So customizing
_/etc/programX.conf_ would trigger a question the next time the
package system wants to update the file.

Instead, splitting _/etc/programX.conf_ into:
* _/etc/programX.conf.d/defaults.programX.conf_
* _/etc/programX.conf.d/custom.programX.conf_
... solves the problem :)
